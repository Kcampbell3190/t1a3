#Instructions: 

The application will open with a menu so that the library staff member can decide which of the features they wish to use. 
To initiate the feature the staff member will need to input the string that matches the feature. 
Inside each if statement is a function that aligns to the feature. 
Then to quit the program all the user needs to do is input quit which will exit the program. 

Feature 1: To use this feature you will ne promted by the app to input data for each of the requirements of signing up a new member. 
once tha information has been recorded the information will be stored as an instance of the LibraryMember class. 

Feature 2: This feature has been designed to check how many days until an item is due. You will be promted to enter the number of days that you have already had the item for. This will then subtract that number from the borrowing period of 14 days. The output will be a number stating how many days the library member has left on an item. If the item is over the 14 days the feature prints out "Your item is overdue please return or renew the item".

Feature 3: To check if a service is available at a particular library you will be prompted to enter the service that is being looked for. The feature will then loop through the services avaialbe dictionary and inform the user if the services is available in an f statement that interlops the key and value from the dictionary. If the service is not available the feature prints out "That service is not available". 

Feature 4: To exit the program simply enter the number 4 and then the program will exit. 


- any dependencies required by the application to operate

This application requires python and terminal to be installed so that it can be used. Since the application runs entirely in the terminal one needs to ensure they can access it. The applicaiton also depends on having the internet as the terminal will need to connect to the github repository to get the link for the code. If you have all these dependencies installed then you can use the app. 

- any system/hardware requirements


The hardware requirements will be a computer that has the ability to have terminal installed. You will also need access to the internet. You will need a screen to be able to read the menu and the following features. 


- how to use any command line arguments made for the application

The application takes very few command line arguments and this makes it easy to use. Most of the time you will be prompted to input a number or word. The application will take this input and convert it to the correct data type. If you need to exit the program enter "5" at the landing menu and this will exit the application.
